# _WEEK 2 REVIEW_

#### Code review week 2 by Riley McAdoo, Oct. 23, 2020

#### By Riley McAdoo

## Description
This website will be my submission for code review week 2. It is a site that allows the user to pick a variety of answers and recieve a random outcome based on their choices. It's not fully working. The idea is you will recieve a random photo and class/language based on what options you choose. I've hit a roadblock and may strip away a lot.


## Setup/Installation Requirements

*  First open up your terminal and enter the following commands to navigate to the portfolio directory. 
    * 'cd desktop' (ensure you start on the desktop to navigate in the terminal)
    * 'cd codereview2'

*  Next, clone the remote repository and create a local copy on your machine using this command:
    * 'git clone https://github.com/riley-mc/codereview2'

*  Type in the link to my portfolio or click here (https://github.com/riley-mc/codereview2).



## Known Bugs

The biggest issue for me right now is that when I click to get my results, nothing happens. I had it working at one point when you clicked the button it would refresh the page, but still not showing the intended images.

I have a toggle function that seems to be working, but I'm wondering if that what's messing me ups because I don't have proper containments of classes or id's.

## Technologies Used

For this website I used GitBash for terminal commands, VSCode for the html, css, javascript, jquery and md files. Google Chrome was used as a browser for testing and reference.
